0 1 4
let say we are now at index 1
agar kisi index i ko1 satisfy kar raha hoga toh 4 toh karega hee.
toh hame 1 ka use nahi
monotonic stack.
[6 , 0 , 8 , 2 , 1 , 5]
o(n) approach
stack ->  (8,5)
lets say for 0 if 1 is possible then but it is not part of because it will have no effect
if it is not part of stack it means
some greater no is in stack already
here in this case it is 5.
